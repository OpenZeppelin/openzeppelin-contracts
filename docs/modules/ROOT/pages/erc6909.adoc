= ERC-6909

ERC-6909 is a draft EIP that draws on ERC-1155 and learnings since it was published in 2018. The main goals of ERC-6909 is to decrease gas costs and complexity--this is mainly accomplished by removing batching and callbacks.

TIP: To understand the inspiration for a multi token standard, see the xref:erc1155.adoc#multi-token-standard[multi token standard] section within the EIP-1155 docs.

== Changes from ERC-1155
There are three main changes from ERC-1155 which are as follows:

. The removal of batch operations.
. The removal of transfer callbacks.
. Granularization in approvals--approvals can be set globally (as operators) or as amounts per token (inspired by ERC20).

== Constructing an ERC-6909 Token Contract

We'll use ERC-6909 to track multiple items in a game, each having their own unique attributes. All item types with by minted to the deployer of the contract, which we can later transfer to players.

For simplicity, we will mint all items in the constructor--however, minting functionality could be added to the contract to min on demand to players.

TIP: For an overview of minting mechanisms, check out xref:erc20-supply.adoc[Creating ERC-20 Supply].

Here's what a contract for tokenized items might look like:

[source,solidity]
----
include::api:example$token/ERC6909/GameItems.sol[]
----

Note that the vanilla xref:api:token/ERC6909.adoc#ERC6909[`ERC6909`] implementation does not have any concept of decimals, but the xref:api:token/ERC6909.adoc#ERC6909Metadata[`ERC6909Metadata`] extension does. This is very useful when some (or all) of the tokens represented by the ERC-6909 contract are fungible. Additionally, there is no content URI functionality in the base implementation, but the xref:api:token/ERC6909.adoc#ERC6909ContentURI[`ERC6909ContentURI`] extension adds it.

Once the contract is deployed, we will be able to query the deployerâ€™s balance:
[source,javascript]
----
> gameItems.balanceOf(deployerAddress,3)
1000000000
----

We can transfer items to player accounts:
[source,javascript]
----
> gameItems.transfer(playerAddress, 2, 1)
> gameItems.balanceOf(playerAddress, 2)
1
> gameItems.balanceOf(deployerAddress, 2)
0
----
