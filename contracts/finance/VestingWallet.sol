/**
 * @dev A vesting wallet is an ownable contract that can receive native currency and ERC-20 tokens, and release these
 * assets to the wallet owner, also referred to as "beneficiary", according to a vesting schedule.
 *
 * Any assets transferred to this contract will follow the vesting schedule as if they were locked from the beginning.
 * Consequently, if the vesting has already started, any amount of tokens sent to this contract will (at least partly)
 * be immediately releasable.
 *
 * By setting the duration to 0, one can configure this contract to behave like an asset timelock that hold tokens for
 * a beneficiary until a specified time.
 *
 * NOTE: Since the wallet is {Ownable}, and ownership can be transferred, it is possible to sell unvested tokens.
 * Preventing this in a smart contract is difficult, considering that: 1) a beneficiary address could be a
 * counterfactually deployed contract, 2) there is likely to be a migration path for EOAs to become contracts in the
 * near future.
 *
 * NOTE: When using this contract with any token whose balance is adjusted automatically (i.e. a rebase token), make
 * sure to account the supply/balance adjustment in the vesting schedule to ensure the vested amount is as intended.
