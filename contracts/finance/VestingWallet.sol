 * @title VestingWallet

 * can be given to this contract, which will release the token to the beneficiary following a given vesting schedule.
 * The vesting schedule is customizable through the {vestedAmount} function.

 * Any token transferred to this contract will follow the vesting schedule as if they were locked from the beginning.
 * Consequently, if the vesting has already started, any amount of tokens sent to this contract will (at least partly)
