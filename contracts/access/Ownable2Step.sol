 * old one. This can help prevent common mistakes, such as transfers of ownership to
 * incorrect accounts, or to contracts that are unable to interact with the
 * permission system.

 * The initial owner is specified at deployment time in the constructor for `Ownable`. This
 * can later be changed with {transferOwnership} and {acceptOwnership}.
 *
 * This module is used through inheritance. It will make available all functions
 * from parent (Ownable).
