/**
 * @dev AccessManager is a central contract to store the permissions of a system.
 *
 * A smart contract under the control of an AccessManager instance is known as a target, and will inherit from the
 * {AccessManaged} contract, be connected to this contract as its manager and implement the {AccessManaged-restricted}
 * modifier on a set of functions selected to be permissioned. Note that any function without this setup won't be
 * effectively restricted.
 *
 * The restriction rules for such functions are defined in terms of "roles" identified by an `uint64` and scoped
 * by target (`address`) and function selectors (`bytes4`). These roles are stored in this contract and can be
 * configured by admins (`ADMIN_ROLE` members) after a delay (see {getTargetAdminDelay}).
 *
 * For each target contract, admins can configure the following without any delay:
 *
 * * The target's {AccessManaged-authority} via {updateAuthority}.
 * * Close or open a target via {setTargetClosed} keeping the permissions intact.
 * * The roles that are allowed (or disallowed) to call a given function (identified by its selector) through {setTargetFunctionRole}.
 *
 * By default every address is member of the `PUBLIC_ROLE` and every target function is restricted to the `ADMIN_ROLE` until configured otherwise.
 * Additionally, each role has the following configuration options restricted to this manager's admins:
 *
 * * A role's admin role via {setRoleAdmin} who can grant or revoke roles.
 * * A role's guardian role via {setRoleGuardian} who's allowed to cancel operations.
 * * A delay in which a role takes effect after being granted through {setGrantDelay}.
 * * A delay of any target's admin action via {setTargetAdminDelay}.
 * * A role label for discoverability purposes with {labelRole}.
 *
 * Any account can be added and removed into any number of these roles by using the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions
 * restricted to each role's admin (see {getRoleAdmin}).
 *
 * Since all the permissions of the managed system can be modified by the admins of this instance, it is expected that
 * they will be highly secured (e.g., a multisig or a well-configured DAO).
 *
 * NOTE: This contract implements a form of the {IAuthority} interface, but {canCall} has additional return data so it
 * doesn't inherit `IAuthority`. It is however compatible with the `IAuthority` interface since the first 32 bytes of
 * the return data are a boolean as expected by that interface.
 *
 * NOTE: Systems that implement other access control mechanisms (for example using {Ownable}) can be paired with an
 * {AccessManager} by transferring permissions (ownership in the case of {Ownable}) directly to the {AccessManager}.
 * Users will be able to interact with these contracts through the {execute} function, following the access rules
 * registered in the {AccessManager}. Keep in mind that in that context, the msg.sender seen by restricted functions
 * will be {AccessManager} itself.
 *
 * WARNING: When granting permissions over an {Ownable} or {AccessControl} contract to an {AccessManager}, be very
 * mindful of the danger associated with functions such as {Ownable-renounceOwnership} or
 * {AccessControl-renounceRole}.
