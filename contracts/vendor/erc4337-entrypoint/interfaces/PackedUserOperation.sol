 * @param callData              - The method call to execute on this account.
 * @param accountGasLimits      - Packed gas limits for validateUserOp and gas limit passed to the callData method call.
 * @param preVerificationGas    - Gas not calculated by the handleOps method, but added to the gas paid.
 *                                Covers batch overhead.
 * @param gasFees               - packed gas fields maxPriorityFeePerGas and maxFeePerGas - Same as EIP-1559 gas parameters.
 * @param paymasterAndData      - If set, this field holds the paymaster address, verification gas limit, postOp gas limit and paymaster-specific extra data
 *                                The paymaster will pay for the transaction instead of the sender.
