 * @dev Simple implementation of a

 * strategy, where the paying contract doesn't interact directly with the
 * receiver account, which must withdraw its payments itself.
 *
 * Pull-payments are often considered the best practice when it comes to sending
 * Ether, security-wise. It prevents recipients from blocking execution, and
 * eliminates reentrancy concerns.
 *

 *
 * To use, derive from the `PullPayment` contract, and use {_asyncTransfer}
 * instead of Solidity's `transfer` function. Payees can query their due
 * payments with {payments}, and retrieve them with {withdrawPayments}.
