/**
 * @dev Extension of {Governor} for fractional voting.
 *
 * Similar to {GovernorCountingSimple}, this contract is a votes counting module for {Governor} that supports 3 options:
 * Against, For, Abstain. Additionally, it includes a fourth option: Fractional, which allows voters to split their voting
 * power amongst the other 3 options.
 *
 * Votes cast with the Fractional support must be accompanied by a `params` argument that is three packed `uint128` values
 * representing the weight the delegate assigns to Against, For, and Abstain respectively. For those votes cast for the other
 * 3 options, the `params` argument must be empty.
 *
 * This is mostly useful when the delegate is a contract that implements its own rules for voting. These delegate-contracts
 * can cast fractional votes according to the preferences of multiple entities delegating their voting power.
 *
 * Some example use cases include:
 *
 * * Voting from tokens that are held by a DeFi pool
 * * Voting from an L2 with tokens held by a bridge
 * * Voting privately from a shielded pool using zero knowledge proofs.
 *
 * Based on ScopeLift's GovernorCountingFractional[https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting/blob/e5de2efd1368387b840931f19f3c184c85842761/src/GovernorCountingFractional.sol]

     * Executing this function consumes (part of) the delegate's weight on the proposal. This weight can be
     * distributed amongst the 3 options (Against, For, Abstain) by specifying a fractional `support`.
     *
     * This counting module supports two vote casting modes: nominal and fractional.
     *
     * - Nominal: A nominal vote is cast by setting `support` to one of the 3 bravo options (Against, For, Abstain).
     * - Fractional: A fractional vote is cast by setting `support` to `type(uint8).max` (255).
     *
     * Casting a nominal vote requires `params` to be empty and consumes the delegate's full remaining weight on the
     * proposal for the specified `support` option. This is similar to the {GovernorCountingSimple} module and follows
     * the `VoteType` enum from Governor Bravo. As a consequence, no vote weight remains unspent so no further voting
     * is possible (for this `proposalId` and this `account`).
     *
     * Casting a fractional vote consumes a fraction of the delegate's remaining weight on the proposal according to the
     * weights the delegate assigns to each support option (Against, For, Abstain respectively). The sum total of the
     * three decoded vote weights _must_ be less than or equal to the delegate's remaining weight on the proposal (i.e.
     * their checkpointed total weight minus votes already cast on the proposal). This format can be produced using:
     *
     * `abi.encodePacked(uint128(againstVotes), uint128(forVotes), uint128(abstainVotes))`
     *
     * NOTE: Consider that fractional voting restricts the number of casted vote (in each category) to 128 bits.
     * Depending on how many decimals the underlying token has, a single voter may require to split their vote into
     * multiple vote operations. For precision higher than ~30 decimals, large token holders may require an
     * potentially large number of calls to cast all their votes. The voter has the possibility to cast all the
     * remaining votes in a single operation using the traditional "bravo" vote.
