/**
 * @dev Extension of {Governor} that binds the execution process to an instance of {TimelockController}. This adds a
 * delay, enforced by the {TimelockController} to all successful proposal (in addition to the voting duration). The
 * {Governor} needs the proposer (and ideally the executor and canceller) roles for the {Governor} to work properly.
 *
 * Using this model means the proposal will be operated by the {TimelockController} and not by the {Governor}. Thus,
 * the assets and permissions must be attached to the {TimelockController}. Any asset sent to the {Governor} will be
 * inaccessible from a proposal, unless executed via {Governor-relay}.
 *
 * WARNING: Setting up the TimelockController to have additional proposers or cancellers besides the governor is very
 * risky, as it grants them the ability to: 1) execute operations as the timelock, and thus possibly performing
 * operations or accessing funds that are expected to only be accessible through a vote, and 2) block governance
 * proposals that have been approved by the voters, effectively executing a Denial of Service attack.
