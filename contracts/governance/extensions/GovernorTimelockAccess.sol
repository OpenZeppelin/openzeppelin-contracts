/**
 * @dev This module connects a {Governor} instance to an {AccessManager} instance, allowing the governor to make calls
 * that are delay-restricted by the manager using the normal {queue} workflow. An optional base delay is applied to
 * operations that are not delayed externally by the manager. Execution of a proposal will be delayed as much as
 * necessary to meet the required delays of all of its operations.
 *
 * This extension allows the governor to hold and use its own assets and permissions, unlike {GovernorTimelockControl}
 * and {GovernorTimelockCompound}, where the timelock is a separate contract that must be the one to hold assets and
 * permissions. Operations that are delay-restricted by the manager, however, will be executed through the
 * {AccessManager-execute} function.
 *
 * ==== Security Considerations
 *
 * Some operations may be cancelable in the `AccessManager` by the admin or a set of guardians, depending on the
 * restricted function being invoked. Since proposals are atomic, the cancellation by a guardian of a single operation
 * in a proposal will cause all of the proposal to become unable to execute. Consider proposing cancellable operations
 * separately.
 *
 * By default, function calls will be routed through the associated `AccessManager` whenever it claims the target
 * function to be restricted by it. However, admins may configure the manager to make that claim for functions that a
 * governor would want to call directly (e.g., token transfers) in an attempt to deny it access to those functions. To
 * mitigate this attack vector, the governor is able to ignore the restrictions claimed by the `AccessManager` using
 * {setAccessManagerIgnored}. While permanent denial of service is mitigated, temporary DoS may still be technically
 * possible. All of the governor's own functions (e.g., {setBaseDelaySeconds}) ignore the `AccessManager` by default.
 *
 * NOTE: `AccessManager` does not support scheduling more than one operation with the same target and calldata at
 * the same time. See {AccessManager-schedule} for a workaround.
