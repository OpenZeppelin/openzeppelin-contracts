/**
 * @dev Extension of {Votes} that adds checkpoints for delegations and balances.
 *
 * WARNING: While this contract extends {Votes}, valid uses of {Votes} may not be compatible with
 * {VotesExtended} without additional considerations. This implementation of {_transferVotingUnits} must
 * run AFTER the voting weight movement is registered, such that it is reflected on {_getVotingUnits}.
 *
 * Said differently, {VotesExtended} MUST be integrated in a way that calls {_transferVotingUnits} AFTER the
 * asset transfer is registered and balances are updated:
 *
 * ```solidity
 * contract VotingToken is Token, VotesExtended {
 *   function transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public override {
 *     super.transfer(from, to, tokenId); // <- Perform the transfer first ...
 *     _transferVotingUnits(from, to, 1); // <- ... then call _transferVotingUnits.
 *   }
 *
 *   function _getVotingUnits(address account) internal view override returns (uint256) {
 *      return balanceOf(account);
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * {ERC20Votes} and {ERC721Votes} follow this pattern and are thus safe to use with {VotesExtended}.
