/**
 * @dev A forwarder compatible with ERC-2771 contracts. See {ERC2771Context}.
 *
 * This forwarder operates on forward requests that include:
 *
 * * `from`: An address to operate on behalf of. It is required to be equal to the request signer.
 * * `to`: The address that should be called.
 * * `value`: The amount of native token to attach with the requested call.
 * * `gas`: The amount of gas limit that will be forwarded with the requested call.
 * * `nonce`: A unique transaction ordering identifier to avoid replayability and request invalidation.
 * * `deadline`: A timestamp after which the request is not executable anymore.
 * * `data`: Encoded `msg.data` to send with the requested call.
 *
 * Relayers are able to submit batches if they are processing a high volume of requests. With high
 * throughput, relayers may run into limitations of the chain such as limits on the number of
 * transactions in the mempool. In these cases the recommendation is to distribute the load among
 * multiple accounts.
 *
 * NOTE: Batching requests includes an optional refund for unused `msg.value` that is achieved by
 * performing a call with empty calldata. While this is within the bounds of ERC-2771 compliance,
 * if the refund receiver happens to consider the forwarder a trusted forwarder, it MUST properly
 * handle `msg.data.length == 0`. `ERC2771Context` in OpenZeppelin Contracts versions prior to 4.9.3
 * do not handle this properly.
 *
 * ==== Security Considerations
 *
 * If a relayer submits a forward request, it should be willing to pay up to 100% of the gas amount
 * specified in the request. This contract does not implement any kind of retribution for this gas,
 * and it is assumed that there is an out of band incentive for relayers to pay for execution on
 * behalf of signers. Often, the relayer is operated by a project that will consider it a user
 * acquisition cost.
 *
 * By offering to pay for gas, relayers are at risk of having that gas used by an attacker toward
 * some other purpose that is not aligned with the expected out of band incentives. If you operate a
 * relayer, consider whitelisting target contracts and function selectors. When relaying ERC-721 or
 * ERC-1155 transfers specifically, consider rejecting the use of the `data` field, since it can be
 * used to execute arbitrary code.
