= Meta Transactions

[.readme-notice]
NOTE: This document is better viewed at https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/metatx

This directory includes contracts for adding meta-transaction capabilities (i.e. abstracting the execution context from the transaction origin) following the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2771[ERC-2771 specification].

- {ERC2771Context}: Provides a mechanism to override the sender and calldata of the execution context (`msg.sender` and `msg.data`) with a custom value specified by a trusted forwarder.
- {ERC2771Forwarder}: A production-ready forwarder that relays operation requests signed off-chain by an EOA.
