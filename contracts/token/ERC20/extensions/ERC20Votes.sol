/**
 * @dev Extension of ERC-20 to support Compound-like voting and delegation. This version is more generic than Compound's,
 * and supports token supply up to 2^208^ - 1, while COMP is limited to 2^96^ - 1.
 *
 * NOTE: This contract does not provide interface compatibility with Compound's COMP token.
 *
 * This extension keeps a history (checkpoints) of each account's vote power. Vote power can be delegated either
 * by calling the {Votes-delegate} function directly, or by providing a signature to be used with {Votes-delegateBySig}. Voting
 * power can be queried through the public accessors {Votes-getVotes} and {Votes-getPastVotes}.
 *
 * By default, token balance does not account for voting power. This makes transfers cheaper. The downside is that it
 * requires users to delegate to themselves in order to activate checkpoints and have their voting power tracked.
