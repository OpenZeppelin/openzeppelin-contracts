/**
 * @dev Extension of {ERC4626} that supports asynchronous deposit flows.
 *
 * This extension implements a time-based delay mechanism for deposits where assets are queued and become
 * gradually available for deposit over a configurable delay period. This provides protection against
 * various forms of economic attacks and allows for controlled capital inflows.
 *
 * The async deposit mechanism works as follows:
 * 1. Users queue assets using {queueDeposit} or {queueMint}
 * 2. Queued assets become gradually available for deposit over time according to {depositDelay}
 * 3. Users call standard {deposit} or {mint} functions to claim available shares
 *
 * The availability schedule is linear: if a user queues assets at time T with delay D, then at time T+x,
 * the fraction x/D of the queued assets will be available for deposit, up to a maximum of all queued assets
 * when x >= D.
 *
 * Multiple queued deposits are tracked using a weighted average timestamp to ensure fair treatment of
 * deposits made at different times.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * This extension modifies the behavior of {maxDeposit} and {maxMint} to respect the async schedule.
 * The {deposit} and {mint} functions will revert if called with amounts exceeding the currently available
 * queued assets, even if the user has sufficient balance and the vault would normally accept the deposit.
 * ====
