/**
 * @dev Extension of ERC20 to support Compound's voting and delegation. This version exactly matches Compound's
 * interface, with the drawback of only supporting supply up to (2^96^ - 1).
 *
 * NOTE: You should use this contract if you need exact compatibility with COMP (for example in order to use your token
 * with Governor Alpha or Bravo) and if you are sure the supply cap of 2^96^ is enough for you. Otherwise, use the
 * {ERC20Votes} variant of this module.
 *
 * This extension keeps a history (checkpoints) of each account's vote power. Vote power can be delegated either
 * by calling the {delegate} function directly, or by providing a signature to be used with {delegateBySig}. Voting
 * power can be queried through the public accessors {getCurrentVotes} and {getPriorVotes}.
 *
 * By default, token balance does not account for voting power. This makes transfers cheaper. The downside is that it
 * requires users to delegate to themselves in order to activate checkpoints and have their voting power tracked.
 *
 * _Available since v4.2._
