/**
 * @dev Extension of {ERC4626} that supports asynchronous withdrawal flows.
 *
 * This extension implements a time-based delay mechanism for withdrawals where shares are queued and become
 * gradually available for redemption over a configurable delay period. This provides protection against
 * bank runs and allows for controlled capital outflows.
 *
 * The async withdrawal mechanism works as follows:
 * 1. Users queue shares for withdrawal using {queueRedeem} or {queueWithdraw}
 * 2. Queued shares become gradually available for redemption over time according to {withdrawDelay}
 * 3. Users call standard {redeem} or {withdraw} functions to claim available assets
 *
 * The availability schedule is linear: if a user queues shares at time T with delay D, then at time T+x,
 * the fraction x/D of the queued shares will be available for withdrawal, up to a maximum of all queued shares
 * when x >= D.
 *
 * Multiple queued withdrawals are tracked using a weighted average timestamp to ensure fair treatment of
 * withdrawal requests made at different times.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * This extension modifies the behavior of {maxWithdraw} and {maxRedeem} to respect the async schedule.
 * The {withdraw} and {redeem} functions will revert if called with amounts exceeding the currently available
 * queued shares, even if the user has sufficient share balance and the vault would normally allow the withdrawal.
 * ====
