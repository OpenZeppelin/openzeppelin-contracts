 * @dev Implementation of the ERC-3156 Flash loans extension, as defined in

 *
 * Adds the {flashLoan} method, which provides flash loan support at the token
 * level. By default there is no fee, but this can be changed by overriding {flashFee}.
 *
 * NOTE: When this extension is used along with the {ERC20Capped} or {ERC20Votes} extensions,
 * {maxFlashLoan} will not correctly reflect the maximum that can be flash minted. We recommend
 * overriding {maxFlashLoan} so that it correctly reflects the supply cap.
