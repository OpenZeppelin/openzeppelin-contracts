/**
 * @dev Implementation of the ERC-4626 "Tokenized Vault Standard" as defined in
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626[ERC-4626].
 *
 * This extension allows the minting and burning of "shares" (represented using the ERC-20 inheritance) in exchange for
 * underlying "assets" through standardized {deposit}, {mint}, {redeem} and {withdraw} workflows. This contract extends
 * the ERC-20 standard. Any additional extensions included along it would affect the "shares" token represented by this
 * contract and not the "assets" token which is an independent contract.
 *
 * This implementation extends {ERC20Vault} and provides the complete ERC-4626 interface including preview functions
 * (see {previewDeposit}, {previewMint}, {previewWithdraw}, {previewRedeem}), deposit and mint functions with max limit
 * checks (see {deposit}, {mint}), and withdraw and redeem functions with max limit checks (see {withdraw}, {redeem}).
 *
 * [NOTE]
 * ====
 * When overriding this contract, some elements must be considered:
 *
 * * When overriding the behavior of the deposit or withdraw mechanisms, it is recommended to override the internal
 * functions. Overriding {_deposit} automatically affects both {deposit} and {mint}. Similarly, overriding {_withdraw}
 * automatically affects both {withdraw} and {redeem}. Overall it is not recommended to override the public facing
 * functions since that could lead to inconsistent behaviors between the {deposit} and {mint} or between {withdraw} and
 * {redeem}, which is documented to have led to loss of funds.
 *
 * * Overrides to the deposit or withdraw mechanism must be reflected in the preview functions as well.
 *
 * * {maxWithdraw} depends on {maxRedeem}. Therefore, overriding {maxRedeem} only is enough. On the other hand,
 * overriding {maxWithdraw} only would have no effect on {maxRedeem}, and could create an inconsistency between the two
 * functions.
 *
 * * If {previewRedeem} is overridden to revert, {maxWithdraw} must be overridden as necessary to ensure it
 * always return successfully.
 * ====

 * For more information on vault security considerations and the underlying mechanics, see {ERC20Vault}.
