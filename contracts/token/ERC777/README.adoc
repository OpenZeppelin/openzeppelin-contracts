= ERC 777
This set of interfaces and contracts are all related to the [ERC777 token standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777).

TIP: For an overview of ERC777 tokens and a walkthrough on how to create a token contract read our xref:ROOT:tokens.adoc#ERC777[ERC777 guide].

The token behavior itself is implemented in the core contracts: {IERC777}, {ERC777}.

Additionally there are interfaces used to develop contracts that react to token movements: {IERC777Sender}, {IERC777Recipient}.
