 * @dev It's recommended that you define constants in the contract,
 * like ROLE_ADMIN below, to avoid typos.
 * @notice RBACWithAdmin is probably too expansive and powerful for your
 * application; an admin is actually able to change any address to any role
 * which is a very large API surface. It's recommended that you follow a strategy
 * of strictly defining the abilities of your roles
 * and the API-surface of your contract.
 * This is just an example for example's sake.
