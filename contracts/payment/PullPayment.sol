/**
 * @dev Simple implementation of a
 * https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/recommendations/#favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls[pull-payment]
 * strategy, where the paying contract doesn't interact directly with the
 * receiver account, which must withdraw its payments itself.
 *
 * Pull-payments are often considered the best practice when it comes to sending
 * Ether, security-wise. It prevents recipients from blocking execution, and
 * eliminates reentrancy concerns.
 *
 * TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways
 * to protect against it, check out our blog post
 * https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/[Reentrancy After Istanbul].
 *
 * To use, derive from the `PullPayment` contract, and use {_asyncTransfer}
 * instead of Solidity's `transfer` function. Payees can query their due
 * payments with {payments}, and retrieve them with {withdrawPayments}.
