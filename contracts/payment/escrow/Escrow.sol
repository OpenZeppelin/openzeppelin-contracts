 /**
  * @title Escrow
  * @dev Base escrow contract, holds funds designated for a payee until they
  * withdraw them.
  *
  * Intended usage: This contract (and derived escrow contracts) should be a
  * standalone contract, that only interacts with the contract that instantiated
  * it. That way, it is guaranteed that all Ether will be handled according to
  * the `Escrow` rules, and there is no need to check for payable functions or
  * transfers in the inheritance tree. The contract that uses the escrow as its
  * payment method should be its owner, and provide public methods redirecting
  * to the escrow's deposit and withdraw.
