/**
 * @dev Base implementation of an ERC-7786 compliant cross-chain message receiver.
 *
 * This abstract contract exposes the `receiveMessage` function that is used for communication with (one or multiple)
 * destination gateways. This contract leaves two functions unimplemented:
 *
 * * {_isAuthorizedGateway}, an internal getter used to verify whether an address is recognised by the contract as a
 * valid ERC-7786 destination gateway. One or multiple gateway can be supported. Note that any malicious address for
 * which this function returns true would be able to impersonate any account on any other chain sending any message.
 *
 * * {_processMessage}, the internal function that will be called with any message that has been validated.
 *
 * This contract implements replay protection, meaning that if two messages are received from the same gateway with the
 * same `receiveId`, then the second one will NOT be executed, regardless of the result of {_isAuthorizedGateway}.
