/**
 * @dev Library for managing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap[binary heap] that can be used as
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue[priority queue].
 *
 * Heaps are represented as a tree of values where the first element (index 0) is the root, and where the node at
 * index i is the child of the node at index (i-1)/2 and the parent of nodes at index 2*i+1 and 2*i+2. Each node
 * stores an element of the heap.
 *
 * The structure is ordered so that each node is bigger than its parent. An immediate consequence is that the
 * highest priority value is the one at the root. This value can be looked up in constant time (O(1)) at
 * `heap.tree[0]`
 *
 * The structure is designed to perform the following operations with the corresponding complexities:
 *
 * * peek (get the highest priority value): O(1)
 * * insert (insert a value): O(log(n))
 * * pop (remove the highest priority value): O(log(n))
 * * replace (replace the highest priority value with a new value): O(log(n))
 * * length (get the number of elements): O(1)
 * * clear (remove all elements): O(1)
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This library allows for the use of custom comparator functions. Given that manipulating
 * memory can lead to unexpected behavior. Consider verifying that the comparator does not manipulate
 * the Heap's state directly and that it follows the Solidity memory safety rules.
