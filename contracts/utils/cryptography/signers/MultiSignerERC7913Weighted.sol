/**
 * @dev Extension of {MultiSignerERC7913} that supports weighted signatures.
 *
 * This contract allows assigning different weights to each signer, enabling more
 * flexible governance schemes. For example, some signers could have higher weight
 * than others, allowing for weighted voting or prioritized authorization.
 *
 * Example of usage:
 *
 * ```solidity
 * contract MyWeightedMultiSignerAccount is Account, MultiSignerERC7913Weighted, Initializable {
 *     function initialize(bytes[] memory signers, uint64[] memory weights, uint64 threshold) public initializer {
 *         _addSigners(signers);
 *         _setSignerWeights(signers, weights);
 *         _setThreshold(threshold);
 *     }
 *
 *     function addSigners(bytes[] memory signers) public onlyEntryPointOrSelf {
 *         _addSigners(signers);
 *     }
 *
 *     function removeSigners(bytes[] memory signers) public onlyEntryPointOrSelf {
 *         _removeSigners(signers);
 *     }
 *
 *     function setThreshold(uint64 threshold) public onlyEntryPointOrSelf {
 *         _setThreshold(threshold);
 *     }
 *
 *     function setSignerWeights(bytes[] memory signers, uint64[] memory weights) public onlyEntryPointOrSelf {
 *         _setSignerWeights(signers, weights);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * IMPORTANT: When setting a threshold value, ensure it matches the scale used for signer weights.
 * For example, if signers have weights like 1, 2, or 3, then a threshold of 4 would require at
 * least two signers (e.g., one with weight 1 and one with weight 3). See {signerWeight}.
