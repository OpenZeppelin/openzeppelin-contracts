 * to record historical balances.
 *
 * When a snapshot is made, the balances and total supply at the time of the snapshot are recorded for later
 * access.
 *
 * To make a snapshot, call the {snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a snapshot id.
 * To get the total supply from a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot id.
 * To get the balance of an account from a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id and the
 * account address.
